# Hotspot
---
HotSpot compiles all reliable support information for all stages of a fire (pre, during, and post) in one place. It displays all that information in a manner accessible to all demographics. It also displays fire vulnerability and Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) data that we hand-created on an interactive world map.

Researching the lack of accessibility for low-income minority groups in California wildfire recovery and support inspired us to make a reliable, informative, and beneficial service that was easily accessible for all groups to help those at risk take the right precautions before a wildfire, stay informed and prepared during one, and take some of the burden of researching where to get/apply for help off of those already being affected by such major losses.



### How to use:
- first cd into the backend/get_demographic_data folder that houses the backend stuff
- then with a venv, make sure to `pip install -r requirements.txt` and everything
- next run `npm install` on the entire app
- next run `npm run dev concurrently`
